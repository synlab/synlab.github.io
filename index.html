									<h2>Introduction</h2>
								</header>
								<p><i>Note: This workshop was previously listed as a full-day workshop. This has now been converted to a half-day workshop to accommodate attendees from different timezones.</i>
									 <br />
									 Modern sensor-equipped mobile devices, personal computers, and other off-the-shelf sensing 
									and computing platforms are sufficiently advanced to support cross-device and tangible interactions 
									with digital media. However, building such interactive experiences is hindered by the complexity of
									setting up and managing the underlying communication and limited tools to explore the opportunities 
									and challenges of these new modes of interaction. In this workshop, we present the Responsive Ecologies
									 Toolkit (RE/Tk), a cross-platform development environment that provides tools to ease the prototyping of 
									 cross-device and tangible applications. Participants will be introduced to key concepts in cross-device 
									 and tangible interactions in the first sessions. Participants will then learn the workflow and features 
									 supported by RE/Tk. In the second session, participants will design and develop cross-device and tangible 
									 experiences of increasing complexity, using devices at hand, within the RE/Tk environment. We expect 
									 participants to explore and understand different modalities of interaction within cross-device environments.</p>

									<h2>Audience and Background</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In this workshop, we will focus on the design and development of cross-device tangible interactions using web technologies by researchers and designers with different levels of programming expertise. Some knowledge of HTML5 and JavaScript would be a plus. Participants will get to attend the workshop remotely using their personal computers for design and development. Participants will be encouraged to use additional devices at hand (smartphones, tablets etc) for testing the applications created using RE/Tk.</p>

								<h2>Workshop Structure</h2>
							</header>
							<p>This is a full-day remote participation workshop. In the first part of the workshop, we will introduce key concepts in cross-device interactions and tangible interactions within responsive ecologies as well as the theoretical framework of RE/Tk.  In the second part of the workshop, the participants will get an opportunity to familiarize with the toolkit and build custom interacive experiences.</p>

							<ul>
								<li><b>HOUR 1:</b> We will start off with introductions and then present key concepts in cross-device interactions and tangible interactions along with examples from literature. We will also engage in a discussion highlighting the challenges and opportunities present in this field.</li>
							    <li><b>HOUR 2:</b> We will introduce the theoretical framework of RE/Tk and present the design rationale, system architecture and features of the toolkit. Participants will learn to use RE/Tk by building simple examples.</li>
								<li><b>HOURS 3 & 4:</b> Participants will get to design and build applications with cross-device and tangible interactions in groups.</li>
								<li><b>Wrap-up:</b> We will share the outcomes and discuss the participants' experiences with the workflow of the toolkit.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							Suggested preparations for the workshop: Aside from your desktop/laptop, you can have a mobile device handy to try out our toolkit.
							<br/>
							We will add further details and instructions for the workshop cloer to the workshop date.</p>

										<h4>Ali Mazalek</h4>
										<p>Ali is the director of the Synaesthetic Media Lab, a playground where physical materials, analog sensors, and digital media happily co-exist and come together in novel ways to support creativity and expression across both science and art disciplines. As a digital media and human-computer interaction researcher, she has spent nearly 20 years trying to get digital technologies to fit better into her physical world and life, rather than letting them drag her into the pixelated depths of her computer screens. At the same time, she has a deep interest in how computational media can support and enhance creative practices and processes, supporting new forms of expression and new ways of thinking and learning.</p>
